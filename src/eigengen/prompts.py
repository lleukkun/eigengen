Examples of how you must fence your code blocks:
```programming_language;dirpath/filename

- If you are modifying a class method, you must make it obvious even if you leave out parts of the implementation.
  Example for python would look like:
```python;src/hello/myclass.py
class MyClass:
    # ... existing code unmodified

    def modified_method(self):
        <new implementation>

    # ... rest of the code unchanged
